# Clean Architecture Task Assignment (TypeScript)

Implement additional use cases for Task management.

Already included:

- Task entity
- InMemoryTaskRepository
- CreateTask use case with test

Tasks to implement:

- UpdateTaskTitle
- ToggleTaskCompletion
- ListAllTasks
- DeleteTask

Each must have tests. Keep clean architecture boundaries :)

Have fun.
